This is a GTM set up of enhanced ecommerce tracking for Shopify. 
It includes UA, GA4 and Google Ads - all from GTM. 
<br>

## For all ecommerce tracking, ensure the below is completed prior to set up;
> 1. Add UA to preferences in Shopify and turn on Ecommerce in UA settings
> 2. Make sure ecommerce settings are switched on for UA 
> 3. If both UA and GA4 coexist, the accounts should NOT be connected in the UA admin settings. GA4 will be getting data from GTM directly. 
<br>
There are three different folders for three different variations of GTM containers, there are different requirements to set up shopify ecommerce tracking. 

[shopify ads](../blob/master/shopify-ads/gtm-ads.json)<br>
includes a GTM container that tracks, enhanced user conversions on the purchase event for google ads <br>

[shopify-ads-googleapp](../blob/master/shopify-ads-googleapp/GTM-Ads-Shopify-GoogleApp.json)<br>
this is still google ads enhanced user conversions on the pruchase however, if shopify account uses the free Google app, it will send through datalayer events automatically and duplicate events (view_item, add_to_cart, purchase). this container separates the duplicates, changes the tag to fire once per page

[shopify-analytics](../blob/master/shopify-analytics/gtm.json)<br>
